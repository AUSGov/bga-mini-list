<p>Before you consider buying a business make sure you have done all your research first. Researching the business that you want to purchase can offer valuable insight into its reputation and potential for growth.</p>
<p>Conducting market research involves evaluating current and potential markets, the industry the business operates in and the number of similar businesses in the area. Look into the following when conducting your market research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the business for sale?</li>
<li>Are there any risks associated with the business?</li>
<li>What kind of industry does the business operate in?</li>
<li>How many businesses are doing similar things?</li>
<li>Does the business have a competitive advantage?</li>
<li>Does the business have loyal customers?</li>
<li>What does your market want and what are they buying?</li>
<li>How is the competition in market changing?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to talk to existing customers, employees and neighbouring business owners to get a view on how the business is doing.</p> </div>

</h2></div>
<hr/>
<div class="body-copy-content" lang="en">
<p>Gather as much information you can on the business you’re interested in before you sign the contract. It’s essential that you review all:</p>
<ul>
<li>financial records</li>
<li>business operations</li>
<li>legal documents</li>
</ul>
<p>These documents help you identify and manage any risks associated when looking at buying the business. You will want to know what you’re buying and what obligations you’re taking on.</p>
<p>To conduct due diligence you'll need to review items such as the business’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Licences and permits</strong> – Are all the correct licences and permits required to run the business available and up to date?</li>
<li><strong>Contracts and leases</strong> – Will the landlord agree to the transfer of the lease agreement or will you have to negotiate a new lease?</li>
<li><strong>Agreements </strong>– Are there any outstanding agreements between the seller and suppliers?</li>
<li><strong>Status of plant, equipment and fixtures </strong>– What kind of equipment and machinery does the business own? Are they in good working order and licenced?</li>
<li><strong>Assets</strong> – What assets does the business have? Does it have any intellectual property?</li>
<li><strong>Inventory </strong>– Is the inventory on-hand being included in the purchase? How is the <a href="">inventory managed</a>, stored and distributed currently? What is the current state of the inventory? </li>
<li><strong>Liabilities</strong> – Does the business have any outstanding debts? What refunds and warranties still exist for the business? Are there debts owing on assets that are registered on the <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Personal Property Securities Register</a>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financial due diligence</h3>
<p>You need to independently collect and check the financial information about the business. Make sure you examine the past three to five years of financials including:</p>
<ul>
<li>tax returns</li>
<li>business activity statements (BAS)</li>
<li>records of accounts receivable and payable</li>
<li>balance sheets </li>
<li>profit and loss records </li>
<li>cash flow statements</li>
<li>sales records</li>
